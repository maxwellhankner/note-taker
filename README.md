# Note Taker

## Description

Note Taker is an appication that allows you to create, read, edit and delete unique notes and reminders. This app functions very similar to any other note taking app, minus all the fluff. And just a heads up, he notes are currently available to anyone with the http link, so feel free to leave your deepest darkest secrets.

## Usage

To use this application:

- Visit the deployed version at: https://rocky-thicket-52692.herokuapp.com/

- Or, to run it locally

Clone the GitHub repository at: https://github.com/maxwellhankner/note-taker

Download and install node.js.

Install dev dependencies, run "npm i", in the terminal

Then, run "node server.js" to run the server on port 8080

Lastly, open a browser and go to localhost:8080 to view the application

## Highlights

Working on this application was a huge learning process and lead to a great understanding of how servers work. Working with others always makes things better, so this project was great for that. Introducing Heroku was also really cool.

## Not Included

I have actually always wanted to create my own note taking application, so I will revisiting this code soon. My idea is to wrap a TODO list, note taker, and journal all into one easy to use location. The idea is that when a though or idea or something small crosses my mind, I can just drop it in here and come back later. I would like each entry to be catagorized by type, so that will be something I focus on. I also want to introduce dating the entries, and maybe allow tags to be added, as well. Lots of ideas to think about, but I like where things have started.
